The Number Guessing Game is a simple and interactive Python project where players try to guess a randomly selected number within a given range. The game gives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. With a limited number of attempts, the game offers a fun challenge while helping beginners practice their Python skills.
